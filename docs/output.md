# Output specification

All output filenames keep prefixes from corresponding input filenames. For example. If you have started from `REP1.fastq.gz` and `REP2.fastq.gz` then corresponding alignment log for each replicate has a filename of `REP1.flagstat.qc` and `REP2.flagstat.qc`, respectively.

Final HTML report (`qc.html`) and QC json (`qc.json`) files do not have any prefix.

1. `DNAnexus`: Output will be stored on the specified output directory without any subdirectories.

2. `Cromwell`: `Cromwell` will store outputs for each task under `cromwell-executions/[WORKFLOW_ID]/call-[TASK_NAME]/shard-[IDX]`. For all tasks except two peak calling tasks `idr` (irreproducible discovery rate) and `overlap` (naive overlapping peaks), `[IDX]` means a zero-based index for each replicate. For two tasks `idr` and `overlap`, `[IDX]` stands for a zero-based index for all possible pair of replicates. For example, you have 3 replicates and all possible combination of two replicates are `[(rep1,rep2), (rep1,rep3), (rep2,rep3)]`. Therefore, `call-idr/shard-2` should be an output directory for the pair of replicate 2 and 3.

For more details, refer to the file table section in an HTML report generated by the pipeline. Files marked as (E) are outputs to be uploaded during ENCODE accession.
